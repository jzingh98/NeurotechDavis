								<h2>Overview</h2>
								<p> Neurotechnology broadly refers to any system that establishes a direct connection between the nervous system and an external electronic device. Neural Interfaces, also called Brain Computer Interfaces (BCIs), have been used for applications ranging from prosthetics to thought based control of drones. Ongoing research efforts are underway at companies and university labs across the world to explore further applications of this technology. </p>

								<h2>Club Organization</h2>
								<p>Neurotech@Davis is an affiliate member of NeurotechX and the <a href="https://neurotechx.github.io/studentclubs/index.html">NeurotechX Student Clubs Initiative</a>. This is a global organization that connects neurotechnology researchers and enthusiasts from across the world to promote innovation in the field. Neurotech@Davis represents the University of California, Davis to this global community. We have ongoing collaborations with other NeurotechX affiliate clubs, including CRUX at UCLA, and we hope to connect with members from other universities to exchange ideas and work together on projects. NeurotechX also organizes an annual compeition which all affiliate members may participate in.</p>
								<p>Our club consists of several division, each working separately to advance our mission.  The Projects group is responsible for designing and engineering exciting new neural interface projects to demonstrate the capabilities of this technology, while providing a learning opportunity to students.  The Research group provides high quality content to our community exploring the latest topics in neurotechnology, computational neuroscience, artificial intelligence, and neuroethics. Our Outreach group organizes events and maintains relationships to promote our organization, and neurotechnology at large, within our community</p>

									<h3>Projects Division</h3>
									<p>Neurotech@Davis plans to carry out several projects throughout the school year to provide a hands on learning experience for students, and to demonstrate existing applications of neural interfaces. We also plan to participate in the NeurotechX Brain Hack competition. <br>
										The projects division offers excellent opportunities to gain hand on experience developing brain-computer interfaces. Each project allows members to develop skills in various hardware and software disciples, as well as basic neurobiology. </p>
								</li>
								<li class="icon solid fa-laptop">
									<h3>Research Division</h3>
									<p>At Neurotech@Davis, we aim to highlight the most relevant breakthroughs and projects in neuroscience, computer science, and the neurotechnology industry as a whole! Check out our Medium blog posts for more information on the latest studies and products in neurotechnology. Contact mpitkin@ucdavis.edu for inquiries. <br>
										This is an excellent opportunity to develop skills researching and writing high quality content on complex, cutting edge topics aimed to educate the public. </p>
